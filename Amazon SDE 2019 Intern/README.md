## Online Assessment Overview
The assessment consists of these components:     
- a coding challenge with two scenarios (up to 90 min)


## 1. Find the states

- Eight houses represented as cells, are arranged in a straight line.  
- Each day every cell completed with its adjacent cells (neighbors).  
- An integer value of 1 represents an active cell and a value of 0 represents inactive cell.  
- If the neighbors on both the side of a cell are either active or inactive, the cell becomes inactive on the other day; otherwise cell becomes active.  
- The two cells on each end have a single adjacent cell, so assume that the occupied space on the opposite side is an inactive cell.  
- Even after updating cell state, consider it's previous state when updating the state of other cells.  
- The state info of all cells should be updates simultaneously.  

Write an algorithm to output state of the cells after the given number of days.  

Input:  

The input to the function consists of two arguments:  
	state: a list of integers representing the current state of cells. 
	days: an integer representing the number of days.  
	
Output:  

Return a list of integers representing the state of cells after the given number of days.  



## 2. Find GCD

- The greatest common divisor(GCD) also called highest common factor(HCF) of `N` numbers is the largest positive integer that divides all numbers without giving a remainder.  
- write an algorithm to determine the GCD of `N` positive integers.  

Input:   

The input to the function consists of two arguments:
	num: an integer representing the number of positive integers(N).
	arr: a list of positive integers.
	
Output:  

Return an integer representing the GCD of the given positive integers.
