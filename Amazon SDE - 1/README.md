# Amazon amcat

## Online Assessment Overview
The assessment consists of these components:     
- a coding challenge with two scenarios (up to 90 min)
- a "describe your approach" section to discuss your coding solutions (up to 15 min)
- a work style survey (up to 15 min)
- a feedback survey (5 min)
   
I am not disclosing the exact questions due to NDA.   
My code has passed all the test cases of Amazon amcat.
The code provided over here is not exactly the same code that I submitted because I have rewritten the code.  
I assure that the solution provided is correct.  



## 1. Nearest delivery stations

- Given an array of points in 2d space and a goal point, write a function that returns the top k closest points to the goal point. 

## 2. Shortest Path

- Given a MxN matrix where each element can either be 0 or 1.    
- We need to find the shortest path between a given source cell to a destination cell.   
- The path can only be created out of a cell if its value is 1.   
- You will be provided with start and goal locations
