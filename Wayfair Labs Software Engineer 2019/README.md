## Round 1 (Codility Online Assessment)
---
- 1st round was codility round.
- I got 3 coding questions which I had to solve in 130 minutes.

1. Bug fix question. You will be given code in a language of your choice and a spec. From there youâ€™ll be asked to find and fix the bug(s) in the code.  

2. Physical Algorithms. You will be asked to write an algorithm to solve a problem related to the physical world. e.g. Given the topology of a mountain pass as an array, write an algorithm to figure out the cheapest way to build a road over the pass. (The actual specs will have a lot more information)  

3. Mathematical Algorithms. Similar to question 2 except the algorithm you will be asked to write is rooted in the mathematical world instead of the physical world.
